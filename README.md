# Road to Ballhalla - Speedrun Ressources

Here you'll get everything I've done for the any% speedrun of Road to Ballhalla.
Feel free to use any of these ressources

There is currently 4 files :

In Main :
- "RouteOptimizer.cpp"
Enter your times for every level, the program will find the best route
  If you don't have a C++ compiler you can go to http://cpp.sh and copy the code here

In LiveSplit Ressources :
- "autosplit.asl"
Script working for LiveSplit. It can detect when you enter a level which make an autosplit during your runs.
Very useful to have a good comparison level to level but doesn't detect the start neither the ending of a run.
  
- "RtB - layout.ssl"
The layout I used during my runs

- "RtB - splits.ssl"
Splits time of last attempts to beat the 19:51 run
